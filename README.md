# ECG-signal-processing-using-ModelSim
ECG signals acquired using a sensor has a lot of noise due to lung sounds and EMG. The noise due to lung sounds, EMG can be removed by using Notch/Peak filter of order greater than 10. Implementation of FPGA in signal processors will make them drastically fast. ECG signal is generated by MATLAB in the form of 8-bit data. The filter coefficients are generated using MATLAB. Discrete Time FIR filter is designed using Verilog code to remove the noise.
